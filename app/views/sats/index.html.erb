              <p>
                The test is $54.50 ($43 without Essay) to take on SAT exam. But many students qualify for waivers.<br>
                If you fall under one of these situations, you qualify for a waiver:

                  <li>You’re enrolled in or eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).</li>
                  <li>Your annual family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.</li>
                  <li>You’re enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., Federal TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).</li>
                  <li>Your family receives public assistance.</li>
                  <li>You live in federally subsidized public housing or a foster home, or are homeless.</li>
                  <li>You are a ward of the state or an orphan.</li>
                  <br>
                If you're unsure if you qualify, ask your high school counselor or reach out to a teacher! There should be NO reason why you should not be able to take the SAT. It's very important for the college admissions process.

            <p>
              If you’re registering online, enter the following information:
              <li>The 12-digit code (each code is good for one registration only)</li>
              <li>The name of a high-school counselor or another authorized person</li>
              <li>The way you qualified for the waiver</li><br>

              If you’re registering by mail, send the fee-waiver card that includes this information:<br>
              <li>The 12-digit code (each code is good for one registration only)</li>
              <li>The name of a high-school counselor or another authorized person</li>
              <li>Your paper registration form</li><br>
              Incomplete cards or forms will be mailed back to you unprocessed.
              <br>
              If you’re testing in the United States or U.S. territories, you can use a fee waiver during the late registration period.
