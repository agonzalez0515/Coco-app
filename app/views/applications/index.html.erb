            <h4>Fee waivers</h4>
            <p>UC will waive application fees for up to four campuses for qualified students who would otherwise be unable to apply for admission. The fee waiver program is for United States citizens, permanent residents, and applicants eligible for AB540 benefits.</p>
            <p>Fee waivers can’t be applied to more than four campuses, regardless of their source (e.g. UC, CollegeBoard/SAT). If you apply to more than four, you’ll need to pay $70 for each additional choice.</p>
          </span>
        </div><br>

      <h5>Applying for a fee waiver</h5>
        <p>You can apply for a fee waiver within the online application and be notified immediately whether you have qualified. You will need to provide your family's income and the number of people supported by that income.</p><br>

      <h5>International fees</h5>
        <p class="light">International and non-immigrant applicants must pay a higher application fee of $80 for each campus selected.</p>

      <p class="light">If you currently attend school in the U.S., however, you may be eligible to pay the lower application fee of $70 per campus.</p>
